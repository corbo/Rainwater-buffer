# Rainwater-buffer

Submitted project for https://hackathon.iot2tangle.io/

## Problem:
    Flooding in rural areas because of heavy rainfall
    
## (Possible) solution:
    Controll rainbarrels by emptying them before another heavy rain shower is expected in order to create a buffer for rainwater. The buffer will prevent the new fallen rainwater to overload the sewer infrastructure.

## Operation:
    Waterlevel in the rainbarrel will be monitored in order to determine it's capacity, fillingstate and degree of rainfall.
    The organisation in charge of the cities sewer can remotely open selected valves to drain the filled rainwater barrels in a controlled fashion.
    
    The waterlevels and capacities are transmitted to the tangle making that information available for the sewer organisation.
    When expecting heavy rainfall in it's area the sewer organisation can select barrels and send a drain command to is, possibly with an accompanying micro payment for the services rendered.
